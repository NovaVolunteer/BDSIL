Dr. Lucina Uddin,10/16/2020,University of Miami,"Decades of cognitive neuroimaging work has identified distinct patterns of brain activation that occur during performance of different tasks, as well as revealed patterns task-general activation and deactivation. These data can in principle be used to provide the basis for constructing biologically informed, data-driven taxonomies of psychological processes. This talk will highlight some of the progress and challenges associated with the construction of cognitive ontologies based on functional neuroimaging data. ","After receiving a Ph.D. in cognitive neuroscience from the psychology department at UCLA in 2006, Dr. Uddin completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the Child Study Center at NYU. For several years she worked as a faculty member in Psychiatry & Behavioral Science at the Stanford School of Medicine before joining the psychology department at the University of Miami in 2014. Her lab is broadly focused on investigating the relationship between brain connectivity and cognition in typical and atypical development. Within a cognitive neuroscience framework, this research combines functional and structural connectivity analyses to examine the organization of large-scale brain networks supporting high-level cognitive processes.

Dr. David Van Essen,10/23/2020,Washington University in St. Louis,"David Van Essen is the Alumni Endowed Professor of Neurobiology at Washington University in St Louis. His laboratory uses collaboratively acquired neuroimaging and neuroanatomical data to study cortical structure, function, connectivity, development, and evolution in humans and nonhuman primates. A major emphasis is on developing and using methods for computerized brain mapping as well as neuroinformatics tools that facilitate data analysis and data sharing. ","Cerebral cortex is the dominant structure of the human brain and is largely responsible for what makes us unique as a species and as individuals. This lecture will discuss how recent advances in noninvasive imaging combined with invasive approaches in animal models are transforming our understanding of human brain structure, function, connectivity, evolution, and development. It will include an overview of basic principles of cortical organization and connectivity from studies of laboratory animals and analyses of individual variability in humans. It will highlight a new map (‘parcellation’) of human cerebral cortex based on data from the Human Connectome Project. Comparisons of cortical organization across species reveal valuable insights regarding what makes us uniquely human. "
Dr. Andrei Irimia,10/30/2020,University of Southern California,"Aging-related brain atrophy is associated with risk for cognitive impairment, functional decline, and dementia relative to lifestyle factors including diet, smoking and physical activity. Prevention studies indicate that brain atrophy is associated with vascular disease risk factors like high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, and hypertension, which are widespread in modern, industrialized populations. Here we describe the Tsimané people of South America, a highly unique population who have a subsistence lifestyle paralleled by uniquely low cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. The epidemiological relationships between brain atrophy, systemic inflammation and CVD risk are explored, particularly relative to longevity, cognitive decline and healthspan.  ","Andrei Irimia, PhD is Assistant Professor of Gerontology, Biomedical Engineering and Neuroscience at the University of Southern California. His laboratory in the Ethel Percy Andrus Gerontology Center uses brain imaging and computational techniques to study the relationship between aging trajectories, brain trauma and neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). His focus includes the vascular dimension of neural degradation and cognitive decline, and in the interaction between cardiovascular health and brain atrophy.

Dr. Tor Wager,11/6/2020,Dartmouth College,"Affective processes—pain and pleasure, desire and dread—are fundamental motivators of behavior and drivers of learning. How are they represented and organized in the brain? In this talk, I provide a picture of the new neuroscience of  human affect grounded in a multivariate predictive modeling approach. In the past years, neuroimaging has undergone a renaissance, combining machine learning with open sharing of data across laboratories. The multivariate predictive modeling approach uses machine learning to construct brain-based models of behavioral outcomes, clinical symptoms, and psychological states. Such models can have much larger effect sizes and be dramatically more reproducible and reliable than effects using traditional analysis approaches. They can also serve both predictive and explanatory goals, providing evidence on the brain features and systems that are necessary and sufficient to explain specific types of human feeling and behavior.   ","Tor Wager is the Diana L. Taylor Distinguished Professor in Neuroscience at Dartmouth College. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in Cognitive Psychology in 2003, and served as an Assistant (2004-2008) and Associate Professor (2009) at Columbia University, and as Associate (2010-2014) and Full Professor (2014-2019) at the University of Colorado, Boulder.

Dr. Jessica Turner,11/13/2020,Georgia State University,"The use of the Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymized Computation (COINSTAC) platform in the Enhancing Neuroimaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) consortium combines the technological approach of decentralized, privacy-preserving analyses with the sociological approach of sharing data. I first present how ENIGMA and COINSTAC support neuroimaging data re-use and analysis, and then showcase their integration with a decentralized meta-analysis of sex differences in schizophrenia.

Dr. Russell Poldrack,12/4/2020,Stanford University,"Ensuring that the results of data analysis are both valid and reproducible is a fundamental responsibility of every data scientist, but both are increasingly difficult in the context of complex analysis workflows and big data. Building off of ideas from software engineering, I will argue that we need to embrace a culture of computational reproducibility.

Dr. Hongwei Dong,12/11/2020,"University of California, Los Angeles","The biological significance of assembling this global wiring diagram of the brain is tantamount to that of the Human Genome Project. However, just as knowing the sequence of three billion base pairs in the human genome reveals little about how our bodies are regulated by genes, constructing the connectome will not directly reveal its functional purpose. The ensuing challenge is to analyze the vast connectivity information in a way that is most conducive to generating new behavioral hypotheses for direct testing. Since behavior is a network phenomenon, it is important to analyze the data at the network level to propagate hypothesis- driven, functional analyses of neural systems, culminating in insights into the etiologies of and treatments for neurological disorders like Parkinson’s disease and autism. In his talk, Dr. Dong will present the progress of the NIH BRAIN Initiative funded Mouse Connectome Project in assembling global neural networks of the whole mouse brain.

Dr. Randy Gollub,2/5/2021,Massachusetts General Hospital,"Neuroimaging captures valuable phenotypic information that can inform the delivery of healthcare. Advanced neuroimaging technologies describe patients’ anatomy and physiology in ever greater detail and at increasing spatiotemporal resolutions. The use of these biomedical imaging technologies during the routine conduct of healthcare, and the electronic recording and storage of the resultant data in various archives and databases, creates the opportunity to extract specific, objective and quantitative individual patient information.

Dr. Maryann Martone,2/12/2021,"University of California, San Diego","Two major tenants of the FAIR data principles promoting interoperability are the use of vocabularies that are themselves FAIR, and representing knowledge in a computable form using open standards. With the emphasis on FAIR, we have seen an uptick in the use of community ontologies such as Gene Ontology and UBERON, the pan species anatomy ontology, across consortia such as the Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE). However, the use of ontologies in neuroscience has always been a challenge as we have yet to settle on a common anatomy nor have the nature or number of cell types in the nervous system been agreed up.

Dr. James Morris,3/5/2021,University of Virginia,"The focus of neuroimaging studies has slowly shifted from mapping specialized systems common to healthy individuals, to understanding how individual variability in these systems allows for the rich phenotypic differences in our population. As individual difference approaches have become more common, concern about reliability of findings has emerged in the field. In order to appropriately leverage the promise of fMRI to draw conclusions about individual differences, new approaches that move from simple associations to predictive frameworks will allow for better causal inference and less false positive findings.

Dr. Neda Jahanshad,4/30/2021,University of Southern California,"Human neuroimaging offers non-invasive insights into the structure and function of the living brain. However, the potential to use imaging to understand the variation in the brain that may confer risk for psychiatric and neurological disorders has been hampered by an overwhelming number of unreproducible findings. Studies with small samples, overly-lenient thresholds for statistical significance, and publication biases tend to seed hypothesis driven research, leading to a cyclic exaggeration of potentially incomplete or biased, unreliable findings.
